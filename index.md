Associate Research Scholar

Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs

Princeton University

After being trained as an atmospheric scientists and participating in environment-population interaction research, I came to Princeton University to study climate impacts on human migration, working in the Center for Policy Research on Energy and the Environment (C-PREE) at Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs.
 
Using advanced quantitative methods to reveal the patterns and mechanisms of human migration responses to climate variabilities is my major research interest. I am especially interested in modeling and predicting human migration flows using network analysis techniques. Inequality in migration responses across gender, race, economic status, etc. is also a crucial part of my current studies.
 
The main projects I am leading now is investigating climate variability origin and destination effects on internal migration in South Africa. I am also leading and participating in multiple projects on drought, flooding, and heatwave impacts on human population and migration.

### Bio

I am working in the Center for Policy Research on Energy and the Environment (C-PREE) at Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, studying climate impacts on human migration with Professor Michael Oppenheimer, focused on quantitative methods for migration modeling and prediction.

Before I came to Princeton University as a postdoctoral research associate, I obtained my Ph.D. degree in atmospheric sciences at Stony Brook University, studied American and Atlantic climate variability and change with Professor Minghua Zhang.

Previous to that, I completed my master’s degree in atmospheric sciences and physical oceanography at Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chineses Academy of Sciences, studied air-sea interaction in Southern Ocean with Professor Jiping Liu.

I achieved my bachelor’s degree in atmospheric sciences at Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, focused on meteorology. My thesis advisor is Shaowen Shou.
